// connect to db supabase and get all the rides
// show all the rides in a card format sorted by location (get client location and sort by distance - haversine formula?)


// features: show all the postRide info
// key info (bolded)
// leaving location: use gmaps geolocation api to get associated location with zipcode
// leaving date


// instead of a profile, maybe just have a my rides section in the home page?
